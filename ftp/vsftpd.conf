# Example vsftpd config file for an anonymous FTP download server.
# The default compiled in settings are fairly paranoid. This sample file
# loosens things up a bit, to make the ftp daemon more usable.
#<anonymous_enable=YES>
# Allow anonymous FTP? (Beware - allowed by default if you comment this out).
anonymous_enable=NO
# Uncomment this to allow local users to log in.
local_enable=YES
# Uncomment this to enable any form of FTP write command.
write_enable=YES
# Default umask for local users is 077. You may wish to change this to 022,
# if your users expect that (022 is used by most other ftpd's)
local_umask=022
# Uncomment this to allow the anonymous FTP user to upload files. This only
# has an effect if the above global write enable is activated. Also, you will
# obviously need to create a directory writable by the FTP user.
#<anon_upload_enable=YES>
# Uncomment this if you want the anonymous FTP user to be able to create
# new directories.
#<anon_mkdir_write_enable=YES>
# Activate logging of uploads/downloads.
xferlog_enable=YES
# Make sure PORT transfer connections originate from port 20 (ftp-data).
connect_from_port_20=YES
# If your machine is multi-homed, set this to the IP address you want
# vsftpd to listen on. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen_ipv6 directive.
listen=YES
# Listen on IPv6 sockets. This directive cannot be used in conjunction
# with the listen directive.
#<listen_ipv6=YES>
# You may restrict local users to their home directories. See the FAQ for
# the possible risks in this before using chroot_local_user or
# chroot_list_enable below.
chroot_local_user=YES
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
# The default compiled in setting for chroot_list_enable is YES.
# If chroot_local_user is YES, then this list becomes a list of users to NOT chroot().
# (Default follows)
#<chroot_list_enable=YES>
# (default follows)
#<chroot_list_file=/etc/vsftpd.chroot_list>
# You may change the default value for timing out an idle session.
# idle_session_timeout=600
# You may change the default value for timing out a data connection.
# data_connection_timeout=120
# It is recommended that you define on your system a unique user which the
# ftp server can use as a totally isolated and unprivileged user.
#<nopriv_user=ftpsecure>
# Enable this and the server will recognise asynchronous ABOR requests. Not
# recommended for security (the code is non-trivial). Unfortunately the
# Linux FTP client aborts transfers as well when the receiving side times
# out, so enabling this is annoying. Uncomment it if you like.
#<async_abor_enable=YES>
pasv_enable=YES
pasv_min_port=21000
pasv_max_port=21010
# Set the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.
# (default follows)
#<pam_service_name=vsftpd>
# Set mapping of virtual usernames to UNIX usernames. If this is enabled, then
# virtual users will not be stored in /etc/passwd. There is only one (global)
# mapping per virtual user (for all services). Two example lines:
# pam_service_name=ftp
# { system:virtual_username   pam_service_name   local_username   password }
